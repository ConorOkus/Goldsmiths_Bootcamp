	<p>
		Boot camps are a great way for those looking to lose weight, drop a clothes size, get stronger, build muscle or improve general fitness and well being. Sessions will include running, skipping, circuits, teams games and lots more. We will be looking to burn anywhere from 600-1000 calories per hour session, while working the entire body throughout. Classes are open to both males and females of all abilities.
		<br />
		<br />

		You will have a trainer who has many years experience in the fitness industry and will be able to motivate and push you harder than you would ever do on your own.

		Workouts will be challenging, exciting and fun every time.

		Classes: Monday 6pm-7pm, Goldsmiths University room RHB 300 with Conor.

		Wednesday 5pm-6pm, Goldsmiths University in the 'Stretch' with Conor.
